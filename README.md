# Advanced: Generative AI for Developers Learning Path

Welcome to the repository supporting the "Advanced: Generative AI for Developers" learning path, brought to you by the [ReallyEasyAI](https://www.youtube.com/@ReallyEasyAI) YouTube channel. This repository contains slide decks, Jupyter notebooks, sample images, and other resources to complement the Google Cloud Skills Boost course series. If you're following the course path or watching the video series, this repository will help you practice and explore key concepts.

## Overview of the Learning Path

This learning path focuses on advanced generative AI concepts and tools for developers, including app developers, machine learning engineers, and data scientists. The path is hosted on [Google Cloud Skills Boost](https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/paths/183) and includes the following topics:

### Learning Modules
1. **Introduction to Image Generation**
   - Learn about diffusion models for generating images, inspired by thermodynamics and physics principles.

2. **Attention Mechanism**
   - Understand attention mechanisms and how they enable neural networks to focus on specific input parts for tasks like translation and summarization.

3. **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**
   - Explore encoder-decoder architectures for sequence-to-sequence tasks like translation, summarization, and question answering.

4. **Transformer Models and BERT Models**
   - Dive into transformer architectures, including the self-attention mechanism, and how BERT revolutionized NLP.

5. **Create Image Captioning Models**
   - Learn to create image captioning models using encoder-decoder designs and train them effectively.

6. **Introduction to Vertex AI Studio**
   - Get started with Vertex AI Studio, leveraging its tools for prototyping and customizing generative AI models.

7. **Vector Search and Embeddings**
   - Build applications using large language models and embeddings with lessons on text/vector search.

8. **Inspect Rich Documents with Gemini Multimodality and Multimodal RAG**
   - Use multimodal prompts to retrieve information from text and visual data while generating explanations.

9. **Responsible AI for Developers: Fairness & Bias**
   - Learn how to identify fairness and mitigate bias in AI/ML applications.

10. **Responsible AI for Developers: Interpretability & Transparency**
    - Discover tools to ensure transparency and interpretability in AI solutions.

11. **Responsible AI for Developers: Privacy & Safety**
    - Explore best practices for privacy and safety in AI using open-source tools.

12. **Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for Generative AI**
    - Streamline deployment and monitoring of generative AI solutions.
